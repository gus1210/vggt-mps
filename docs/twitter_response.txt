@ducha_aiki You're absolutely right - caught me with placeholder code! ðŸ˜… Just pushed the fix with real VGGT implementation:

âœ… Now uses actual VGGT-1B model (5GB weights)
âœ… Real depth/camera/3D predictions on MPS
âœ… No more synthetic gradients

The stubs were from initial testing - forgot to swap them out. Thanks for the callout! Updated repo should work properly now with full MPS acceleration for the real model.

Tested on M2 Max, getting good perf with float32 (MPS doesn't support bfloat16 yet). Let me know if you hit any issues!
